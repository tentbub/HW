Something to note
Notice in the html file there is a line at the bottom of the body tag that reads:

<script src="index.js"></script>

This is the line of code that will pull in our javascript code from index.js

The Goal
When the button is clicked show the hidden content(Make it display: block;). If the button is clicked again hide the hidden content(Make it display: none;).
Every time the button is clicked have the counter go up by one.

Research
To accomplish these tasks you are going to need to look up how to access the styles from javascript and the text content. Here are some links to help:
